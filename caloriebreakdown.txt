calorie breakdown:
To determine your basal metabolic rate (BMR), aka how many calories your body burns at rest, use the following formula:

FORMULA FOR BMR:
W = weight in kilograms	(weight (lbs)/2.2) =weight in kg
H = height in centimeters (inches x 2.54) =height in cm
A = age in years

Men: BMR=66.47+ (13.75 x W) + (5.0 x H) - (6.75 x A)
Women: BMR=665.09 + (9.56 x W) + (1.84 x H) - (4.67 x A)
